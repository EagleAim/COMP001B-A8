    <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
    <p>I felt like the leactures really helped over the eight weeks and struggled a bit when I lost notes or was not able to show up. Also I felt like the slides helped a bit when I was stuck so I could go back over what we learned in class.</p>

    <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
    <p>I think I would post a public repository like the Java class so if I was stuck on something I can just look thru what was the leacture activity was expost to look like.</p>

    <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course? </h1>
    <p>I learned everything that I can from the course just might take me a little extra longer to get drilled in my head, but yes this is what i expected a CCS course to be like.</p>

    <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
    <p>The Id selectors was new and very useful. I feel like it could really help. Especialy in html we only really edited the element.</p>
